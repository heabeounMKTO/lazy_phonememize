## why?
i need some sort of text to phonememize library in rust ,
im too lazy to think of a solution other than to bind to libespeak-ng 

## how to build
~~## 1. install espeak dependencies~~
~~`apt-get install libespeak-ng-dev` then ,~~ 
run 
```
make
```

## then , build/run the example rust program
```
cargo build --release
cargo run --release
``
